# Bible Talker

In this demo project I wrote a simple Markov model to take in a body of text (the bible) and create new sentences using the probabilities of word sequences found in the text.

Sample output (using make_canonical_sentence(20)):
> gnashed upon the lord and he shall be a man of israel to pass when they were in his hand
